👋 Hi, I'm Iconexhub

🚀 **Aspiring Backend, AI & Cybersecurity Engineer**  
💡 Passionate about building **secure, reliable backend systems** and **intelligent applications**

---

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On
- Building foundational backend engineering skills (APIs, databases, authentication)
- Learning how scalable backend systems are designed and deployed
- Exploring AI and cybersecurity applications, especially intrusion detection systems
- Gradually moving toward cloud-based deployment and backend infrastructure

---

## 🧠 Backend Engineering Focus
I’m actively developing my backend engineering skills with an emphasis on:

- RESTful API design and request/response workflows  
- Backend application logic and data flow  
- Authentication and basic authorization concepts  
- Working with databases (CRUD operations, schema design fundamentals)  
- Understanding asynchronous processing and background tasks  
- Learning how scalable and production-ready systems are structured  

I’m particularly interested in how backend systems evolve from small projects into reliable, scalable platforms.
